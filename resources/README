#### Add a new repository to the structure
This script does not account for the optional courses, and any other kinds of repositories. If you want these in the structure you can follow these steps:

1. To add a repository to the structure, [create](https://github.com/new) a repository as usual. [(Guide)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo)
2. Move into the parent repository you want to add the repository within e.g `cd first_semester`
3. Use the command `git submodule add <URL>`
4. Commit the newly added submodule within the parent repository
